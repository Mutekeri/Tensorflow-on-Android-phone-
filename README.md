Numerical Recognition using tensorflow on an android phone

# Tensorflow model in android studio

The model was developed on android studio on a windows machine. I wanted to try the
iphone but its seems you can only use the mac book or rent one which was going to be 
very costly. Considering all the hustle of downloading Xcode and registering as a 
developer on the apple website. As an iphone use, I was very disappointed
until I managed to develop using Android simulator. Depending on the client
we can deploy to suit the client. I can develop a video for the steps, please 
contact me on mikemutek@gmail.com if there are any problems.
